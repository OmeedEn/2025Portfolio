# Project Images

Place your project images in this folder. The following images are expected based on your project data:

## Required Images:

1. `degreemate.jpg` - DegreeMate project screenshot
2. `app4apps.jpg` - App4Apps project screenshot
3. `skin-cancer.jpg` - Skin Cancer Detection App screenshot
4. `cyber-chat.jpg` - Cyber Chat project screenshot
5. `finance.jpg` - Financial Analysis Tool screenshot
6. `face-detection.jpg` - Face Detection System screenshot

## Image Guidelines:

- **Format**: JPG, PNG, WebP, or SVG
- **Recommended size**: 1200x630px (16:9 aspect ratio works best)
- **Max file size**: Keep under 500KB for optimal loading (SVGs are typically very small)
- **Quality**: Use high-quality screenshots or mockups
- **Naming**: Use lowercase with hyphens (e.g., `degreemate.jpg`, `degreemate.svg`)

**Note**: SVG files are fully supported and work great for logos, diagrams, or vector illustrations. They scale perfectly at any size and typically have very small file sizes.

## Tips for Good Project Images:

1. Use actual screenshots of your application
2. Create mockups using tools like Figma or Canva if you don't have screenshots
3. Ensure the image clearly represents your project
4. Consider using a clean, professional background
5. For APIs without UI, consider using architecture diagrams or code snippets

## Placeholder Images:

If you don't have images ready, you can use placeholder services temporarily:
- https://placehold.co/1200x630/1e40af/60a5fa?text=Project+Name
- https://via.placeholder.com/1200x630

Simply replace the image paths in `/data/projects.ts` with the placeholder URL until you have real images.
